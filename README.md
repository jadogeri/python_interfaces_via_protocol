Here is the updated Getting Started section. I have corrected the paths to reflect that your requirements.txt is now inside the app folder and added the essential "Sources Root" step for PyCharm.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Installation

#### Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jadogeri/python_interfaces_via_protocol.git
cd python_interfaces_via_protocol

#### Install dependencies from the app directory
```bash
pip install -r app/requirements.txt
```

### 2. Running the Application (PyCharm)

   1. Open Project: Open the root folder python_interfaces_via_protocol in PyCharm.
   2. Set Sources Root: Right-click the app folder in the Project sidebar → Mark Directory as → Sources Root (this turns the folder blue).
   3. Run: Navigate to app/main.py, right-click the file, and select Run 'main'.

### 3. Running the Application (Command Line)

#### Navigate to the app directory and run
```bash
cd app
python main.py
```

## 🧪 Running Tests

##### Ensure you are in the app directory
```bash
cd app
pytest tests.py
```
or

##### Ensure you are outside the app directory

```bash
python -m unittest app/tests.py

```

Note: This might require you to have your imports perfectly aligned or use PYTHONPATH if you get a ModuleNotFoundError.

### Run using the pytest configuration
PYTHONPATH=app pytest app/tests.py
